Mozzes is a lightweight and easy to use Java middleware framework built using [google-guice](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice).

Mozzes aims at developers who don't want to invest time in heavyweight middle tier solutions, e.g. JBoss, to get simple tasks done. There are no confusing XML files buried somewhere deep in the filesystem; Mozzes is a simple service-oriented framework relying on plugins to get the job done.


The framework already contains built-in plugins for:
  * JDBC transaction management
  * Hibernate transaction management
  * Remoting (socket) client access
  * Servlet client access
  * REST client access
  * etc.
